## Running Locally

### Option 1: Direct File Opening
Simply open `currency-converter.html` in your web browser.

### Option 2: Local Server (Recommended)
For the best experience and to avoid CORS issues:

```bash
# Navigate to the project directory
cd /Users/haxtelz/Developer/tictactoe-game

# Start a local server (Python 3)
python3 -m http.server 8000

# Or with Node.js (if you have it installed)
npx serve .

# Or with PHP (if you have it installed)
php -S localhost:8000
```

Then open `http://localhost:8000/currency-converter.html` in your browser.

## API Integration

The application uses the ExchangeRate-API service:
- **Demo Mode**: Currently using demo endpoints (limited but functional)
- **Production**: For production use, get a free API key from [ExchangeRate-API](https://exchangerate-api.com)
- **Fallback**: If the API is unavailable, fallback rates are used

### To use your own API key:
1. Get a free API key from ExchangeRate-API
2. Open `currency-script.js`
3. Replace `'demo'` with your actual API key:
   ```javascript
   this.apiKey = 'your-actual-api-key-here';
   ```

## Browser Support

- ‚úÖ Chrome 60+
- ‚úÖ Firefox 55+
- ‚úÖ Safari 12+
- ‚úÖ Edge 79+

## Customization

### Adding More Currencies
Edit the `<select>` options in `currency-converter.html` and add corresponding rates in the fallback rates object in `currency-script.js`.

### Styling
Modify `currency-style.css` to change colors, fonts, or layout. The design uses CSS custom properties for easy theming.

### Functionality
Extend `currency-script.js` to add features like:
- Historical exchange rates
- Currency rate charts
- Favorite currency pairs
- Rate change notifications
